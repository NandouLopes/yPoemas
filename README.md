# The_Endless_Book

Hi... my name is Fernando and I'm from Brazil.
My project is called "Livro-Vivo"... something like "Alive-Book".
It creates randomic texts and poems, is ready & working but...
in a different IDE - called Xailer - wich means it only runs in local machines.
I hope someone here know this IDE: it will help a lot!

For now I have something like 4,70 x 10E 1631 different texts/poems.
I would love to share this 'creation' in the Internet.

At the moment i'm working with kivyMD to build my app.
Like it? Contact me for more details.
